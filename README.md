The **AI-Powered Meeting Assistant** project represents a successful fusion of advanced technologies to automate and enhance the meeting documentation process. Its core capability lies in the **end-to-end transformation of raw audio into structured, actionable meeting minutes and tasks**, particularly excelling in the complex domain of financial discussions. The solution utilizes **OpenAI Whisper** for highly accurate initial speech-to-text transcription, followed by specialized text correction via an **IBM watsonx.ai Large Language Model (LLM) specifically, Llama-3-2—to clean the transcript and ensure proper expansion of financial acronyms and terminology. Finally, the cleaned text is processed by a LangChain pipeline, which incorporates a second LLM (Granite-3) guided by a **PromptTemplate**, to intelligently extract and format the definitive **Key Decisions, Action Items, and Summaries**, all seamlessly integrated and delivered through a user-friendly **Gradio** web interface.
